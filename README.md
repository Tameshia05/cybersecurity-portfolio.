Name: Tameshia  Michelle Adams  
Hometown: Atlanta, Georgia, USA  

**Prior IT Experience:**  
I am new to the field of IT, but I am deeply passionate about technology, online privacy, and digital safety. I became interested in cybersecurity after learning about the vulnerability of our data in today's world, and I want to help protect people and organizations from cyber threats.

**Career Plans:**  
After completing my cybersecurity course, I plan to pursue roles such as Security Analyst or SOC Analyst. My long-term goal is to specialize in threat intelligence or digital forensics, to investigate and prevent cybercrime.

**Proud Project/Task:**  
One of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of is a beginner-level security audit I performed on my home network. I identified vulnerabilities in my Wi-Fi settings and successfully secured the network using WPA3 encryption and better firewall settings. This gave me the confidence to apply what I've learned to real-world problems.
